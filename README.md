Dear Sir/Madam,

Unfortunately, I was not able to complete the modules or project for my MS3 before the hard deadline had passed and was unable to get an extension. After talking with Ulysses Ryan-Flynn in Student Care, I was advised it would be best to submit a webpage and a note explaining my circumstances to the assessment team. Because this will be counted as a minimal attempt, I am aware that I will now only be eligible for 1 resubmission attempt instead of the usual 2 .

Yours faithfully,

Colm
